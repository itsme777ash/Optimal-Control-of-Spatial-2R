# Optimal-Control-of-Spatial-2R

This repository contains code for optimal control of Spatial 2R mechanism using Taylor Approximation and Feedback Linearization methods. The gains for both the cases were calculated using LQR. The dynamic equations of the mechanism was derived using **DeNOC Algorithm**.  
I**NE_Algo_3R.mlx** - Simulation using Recursive Newton-Euler algorithm(DeNOC).  
The results can be seen in **Results.pdf** and the animation in **animation.gif**
