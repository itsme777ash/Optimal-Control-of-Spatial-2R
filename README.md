# Optimal-Control-of-Spatial-2R

This repository contains code for optimal control of Spatial 2R mechanism using Taylor Approximation and Feedback Linearization methods. The gains for both the cases were calculated using LQR. The dynamic equations of the mechanism was derived using **DeNOC Algorithm**.  
**Spatial_2R_ash_3.mlx** - Contains the code for recursive Newton Euler algorithm and control strategies. Also includes simulation environment using ode45.
